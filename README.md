# Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to gain practical experience in both Python programming and understanding the functionality of basic malware. By creating a keylogger, we aim to explore the intricacies of capturing keyboard input on a system and logging it for analysis. This project serves as an educational endeavor to understand how such software operates, the potential implications of its usage, and the methods employed to develop and defend against it.

Through this project, we seek to achieve the following goals:
- Learn Python Programming: Utilize Python's features and libraries to develop a functional keylogger capable of capturing keystrokes on various platforms.
- Understand Malware Concepts: Gain insights into the fundamental principles of malware, including its definition, types, and potential impact on systems.
- Explore Keylogging Techniques: Investigate different methods of capturing keystrokes, including low-level keyboard hooks and event listeners, to understand their advantages and limitations.
- Implement Stealth and Persistence: Explore techniques to make the keylogger run stealthily and persistently on a target system, while evading detection by security software.
- Ensure Ethical Considerations: Maintain a strong awareness of ethical boundaries throughout the development process, emphasizing responsible usage and respecting privacy rights.
- Contribute to Cybersecurity Awareness: Use the knowledge gained from this project to educate others about the risks associated with keyloggers and the importance of cybersecurity measures.

# Code
As I delve into Python, I'm uncovering a world of possibilities. Through this project, I'm learning its syntax, understanding its data structures, and grasping its core concepts. In this code I was able to import packages and create/amend files.</br>

# Save File
Here was the save file that contains all the keystrokes. </br>
In a future project I will try to email this out via a SMTP email service

# Conclusion 
In conclusion, this project has been a comprehensive exploration into the realm of Python programming and basic malware concepts. Through developing a keylogger, I gained practical experience in Python syntax, data structures, and core concepts. I deepened my understanding of how keylogging techniques function and the potential implications they pose in terms of privacy and security.

Moreover, I delved into the ethical considerations surrounding the development and usage of such software, emphasizing responsible coding practices and the importance of respecting privacy rights. Additionally, I explored methods to enhance the stealth and persistence of the keylogger while evading detection by security software.

Through this journey, I not only expanded my technical skills but also cultivated a deeper awareness of cybersecurity principles and ethical conduct in programming. This project served as a valuable stepping stone in my learning journey, equipping me with practical insights that extend beyond the realm of Python programming into the broader landscape of cybersecurity and ethical coding practices.
